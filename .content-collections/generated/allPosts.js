This page will describe the functionality\nof these capabilities divided into categories of customers, products, materials, suppliers, and orders.\n\n### Customer Tracking\n\nThis is a simple function of the website, allowing the user to add, edit, and delete customers in a SQLite database through a simple user interface provided by the application.\n\n![Screenshot of customer listing page in Gorilla Carts.](/images/customers.webp)\n\n### Product Tracking\n\nThis function of the website allows the user to view products available for sale to its customers. Clicking on the Product ID of each product will allow the user to quickly view the Bill of Materials (BOM) for that particular product.\n\n![Screenshot of product listing page in Gorilla Carts.](/images/products.webp)\n\nExploding the bill of materials (BOM) of a product allows procurement in the organization to plan appropriately when purchasing raw materials. Visualizing item numbers and quantities of raw materials required is also a very important part prior to production, as lacking the correct amount of materials for production could halt a production line.\n\n![Screenshot of bill of materials (BOM) page in Gorilla Carts.](/images/bom.webp)\n\n### Materials Tracking\n\nAfter gaining an understanding of what materials are required for production of a product, another important factor in planning is understanding how many raw materials are available. These quantities as well as information about materials can then be adjusted based on receival of new materials or changes upon an inventory count.\n\n![Screenshot of materials page in Gorilla Carts.](/images/materials.webp)\n\n### Supplier Tracking\n\nThis is another simple but necessary function of the website, allowing the user to add, edit, and delete suppliers in a SQL database through a simple user interface provided by the application.\n\n![Screenshot of suppliers page in Gorilla Carts.](/images/suppliers.webp)\n\n### Order Tracking\n\nThis screen allows the user to view what orders have been placed, the customer who is expecting the order, the employee who placed the order, as well as the order total cost for the customer.\n\n![Screenshot of orders page in Gorilla Carts.](/images/orders.webp)\n\nViewing an invoice from an order will allow for further details that may be necesary during production or for quality control purposes, such as when the order was placed and what particular product was purchased by the customer.\n\n![Screenshot of an invoice page in Gorilla Carts.](/images/invoice.webp)\n\n### Order Placing\n\nAs the most complex portion of the website, it is also necessary that employees are able to place orders for customers on this website. Necessary information includes the customer ordering, the employee that is placing the order, as well as the particular product being purchased. When an order is placed, the necessary amount of materials for production are allocated to this product and are removed from the existing inventory.\n\n![Screenshot of the order placement page in Gorilla Carts.](/images/placeorder.webp)\n\nWhile this functionality may seem simple, it is actually quite complex as it has two strict requirements: 1) An order may not be placed if there are not enough raw materials determined by the BOM and order quantity to produce any particular product, and 2) No order may place an order for more than 10 of the same cart.

    "description": "A late-night coding session is almost foiled by Starbucks' Wi-Fi.",
    "publishedAt": "2025-10-10",
    "content": "Sitting in a public corner outside of a Starbucks on a warm summer night, I opened the lid of my laptop\nto work on a personal coding project. As I connected to the store's Wi-Fi, I ran into a new issue I had never seen before:\n\n![A screenshot of the Starbucks Wi-Fi portal noting \"Our store is currently closed. Please join us during normal store business hours.\"](/images/starbucks-closed-image.png)\n\nAt first glance, this indicates that Starbucks doesn't allow users to access their Wi-Fi network after-hours.\n\nNaturally, I unlocked my iPhone and navigated to the Settings app to enable my Personal\nHotspot. As I was going through the motions, I noticed something interesting. My phone was already connected to the Wi-Fi. And it was working. At a second glance, it appears the coffee chain doesn't allow _new_ users to connect to their Wi-Fi after doors have closed.\n\nThis creates the opportunity for a simple (and arguably uninteresting) loophole: What if I tricked the Wi-Fi network into thinking I was connecting from my phone\nrather than my MacBook? I figured out this could be accomplished with a few quick steps.\n\n1. Find (and note down) the MAC address of the device that has previously connected to the network.\n2. Disconnect that device from the network.\n3. Mask the MAC address of the desired device with the previously noted address.\n4. Connect to the Wi-Fi network with the desired device.\n\nI admit I needed to do a little bit of Googling for two of these steps, but I was able to connect without a hiccup.\n\n![A screenshot of a terminal window attempting to ping Google's DNS server successfully.](/images/terminal-ping-test.png)\n\nEver been on an airplane and been greeted with extreme Wi-Fi pricing on a laptop, while you can gain free access with a phone through your carrier? If you've been on an American Airlines flight as a T-Mobile customer, probably. You could use the previous trick as a workaround to switch access between devices as you please, but I have also solved this in a different way.\n\n![A screenshot of T-Mobile's access portal to connect to Wi-Fi on an American Airlines flight.](/images/t-mobile-viasat.webp)\n\nIf you have access to a Chromium-based browser, there are a couple easy steps that can be followed to trigger the mobile phone Wi-Fi pricing tab.\n\n1. Connect to the Wi-Fi network with your laptop. Allow the captive portal page to open.\n2. Enter your web browser's developer tools menu, then toggle the device toolbar. From there, I like to select the sizing of an iPhone 12 Pro.\n3. Within the console drawer, navigate to the \"Network conditions\" tab. From there, update the \"User agent\" variable to reference \"Chrome - iPhone\".\n4. Refresh or navigate to the portion of the captive portal where internet connectivity can be purchased.\n5. Go through the motions as you would when connecting with your phone.\n\n![A screenshot of the fully configured browser developer tools window.](/images/browser-devtools.png)\n\nI’m always ecstatic when I find a way to solve little tech issues, no matter how small. I’ve found myself going back to these steps many times, and I hope you don't have to. But if you do, now you know some ways to get around it.",
