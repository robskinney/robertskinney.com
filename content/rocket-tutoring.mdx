**NOTE:** This project is currently under construction, being revamped to a B2B2C tutoring platform. Some pages will not work as expected.

This program was created as a passion project, allowing students and tutors to easily connect with each other.

### Course Lookup

Users can easily search for available courses by navigating to their desired school from the home page, allowing them to easily get connected with tutors.

### Easy Scheduling

Sessions can be quickly scheduled with tutors by looking at their scheduling assistant, automatically marking availability based on the student and tutor's schedules within the website.

### Video Calls

Sessions can easily be handled through the Rocket Tutoring website, allowing for video chat, screen sharing, whiteboard usage, code sharing, and more. Whether users are learning ASL, writing chemistry equations, or looking to sharpen up on their Python, all can be done within the comfort of one website.

### Chats

Users can rapidly communicate with each other using the built-in chat feature, receiving email notifications for any chats they may have missed.

### Payment

Accounts can be quickly topped off using the deposit function handled by Stripe. Account balances will be held at the time of requesting a session, automatically paying a tutor once the session is complete.

### Robust Preferences

Users can adjust their profiles to their liking with custom profile pictures, favorite subjects, hometown information, and more. This is also the best location to update tutor preferences, see your contacts, and even output an Excel format of transaction history for analysis.

### Site Administration

Administrators can add or manage existing schools or courses using AI to assist in filling out information about the entry being added to the database. This is also where tutors can be enabled after their request to join the team has been accepted.

### Tech Stack

This website uses Next.js (a React framework) with the App router and TypeScript to portray its webpages. Backend data is stored in a Postgresql database using Supabase as an ORM, alongside documents such as resumes or profile pictures being stored in an AWS bucket. Meetings are held using the Dyte video calling API.
