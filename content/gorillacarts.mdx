This program was created during a graduate business course, using over 1,000 lines of logic to perform business functions required by a fictional client, Gorilla Carts. Meant to be interacted with
by employees of the organization, there are several tabs that allow an employee to perform their daily business functions. This page will describe the functionality
of these capabilities divided into categories of customers, products, materials, suppliers, and orders.

### Customer Tracking

This is a simple function of the website, allowing the user to add, edit, and delete customers in a SQLite database through a simple user interface provided by the application.

### Product Tracking

This function of the website allows the user to view products available for sale to its customers. Clicking on the Product ID of each product will allow the user to quickly view the Bill of Materials (BOM) for that particular product.

Exploding the bill of materials (BOM) of a product allows procurement in the organization to plan appropriately when purchasing raw materials. Visualizing item numbers and quantities of raw materials required is also a very important part prior to production, as lacking the correct amount of materials for production could halt a production line.

### Materials Tracking

After gaining an understanding of what materials are required for production of a product, another important factor in planning is understanding how many raw materials are available. These quantities as well as information about materials can then be adjusted based on receival of new materials or changes upon an inventory count.

### Supplier Tracking

This is another simple but necessary function of the website, allowing the user to add, edit, and delete suppliers in a SQL database through a simple user interface provided by the application.

### Order Tracking

This screen allows the user to view what orders have been placed, the customer who is expecting the order, the employee who placed the order, as well as the order total cost for the customer.

Viewing an invoice from an order will allow for further details that may be necesary during production or for quality control purposes, such as when the order was placed and what particular product was purchased by the customer.

### Order Placing

As the most complex portion of the website, it is also necessary that employees are able to place orders for customers on this website. Necessary information includes the customer ordering, the employee that is placing the order, as well as the particular product being purchased. When an order is placed, the necessary amount of materials for production are allocated to this product and are removed from the existing inventory.

While this functionality may seem simple, it is actually quite complex as it has two strict requirements: 1) An order may not be placed if there are not enough raw materials determined by the BOM and order quantity to produce any particular product, and 2) No order may place an order for more than 10 of the same cart. An example of the first error has been shown below.

### Tech Stack

This project uses Flask and Python as its backend framework to connect to a SQLite database, painting relevant information on HTML templates using Bootstrap for CSS.
