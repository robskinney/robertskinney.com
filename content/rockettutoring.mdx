This program was created as a passion project, allowing students and tutors to easily connect with each other.

### Robust Preferences

Users can adjust their profiles to their liking with custom profile pictures, favorite subjects, hometown information, and more. This is also the best location to update tutor preferences, see your contacts, and even output an Excel format of transaction history for analysis.

### Site Administration

Administrators can add or manage existing schools or courses using AI to assist in filling out information about the entry being added to the database. This is also where tutors can be enabled after their request to join the team has been accepted.

### Tech Stack

This website uses Next.js (a React framework) with the App router and TypeScript to portray its webpages. Backend data is stored in a Postgresql database using Supabase as an ORM, alongside documents such as resumes or profile pictures being stored in an AWS bucket. Meetings are held using the Dyte video calling API.
