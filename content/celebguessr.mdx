This program was created as a passion project, automatically generating a new actor or actress every day. On the backend, there is a network of actors and actresses as nodes, all connected via edges by the different movies they have played in. The user has a choice to take 3 tips about the actor, and each guess will indicate how far they are away from the actor by movies of separation.

### Main page

This page simply shows what game today is, how many guesses have been taken, and provides an opportunity to enter a guess or request a tip.

### Share page

Once the game has been won, the user is presented with statistics based on other people's games, provides a countdown until the next game, and allows the user to share the results with their friends. Sharing uses a modern share API compatible with most modern web browsers, pulling up a modern share menu Wordle players may be familiar with.

### Tech Stack

This project uses Flask and Python as its backend framework to connect to a SQLite database. A backend database stores a network of actors and actresses connected by movies they have starred in, generated by NetworkX in Python. Information is portrayed via HTML templates using Bootstrap for CSS.
